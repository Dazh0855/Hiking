# Romig_CSCI2270_FinalProject_

Our group's goal for the final project is using a graph to find the shortest distance to the top of a mountain for a hiking group. Our code will implement and print the paths to the top, find the shortest path, shortest distance, and the shortest distance if the hikers wanted to backpack through all the mountain's locations. By using a graphs and dijkstra's algorithm, our project can display the shortest distance for the hikers as well as the most efficient way to travel the mountain when backpacking. Our group consists of Carly Romig and Daniel Zhou from Upendra Sabnis' 8:00 a.m. recitation. Hi
